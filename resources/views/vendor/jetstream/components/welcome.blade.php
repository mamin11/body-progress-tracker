        Here's how the measurements you have been taking are doing. If you cannot see anything in the graphs, it is 
        because you have not inserted any records. You can insert data by going to the insert page and then 
        enter the data for different records. If you entered a record and you want to change it, go to the 
        edit page and you will be able to both edit and delete records.
